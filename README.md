# Budget Application
This web application tracks user's budget via user updates of purchases. This application incorporates Materialize and Web APIs (Rainforest/GIPHY). 

## USER STORY  
AS A person who has a limited amount of spendings available
I WANT to log my purchases
SO THAT I can see my remaining budget

## Project Aims 
* User types in a budget and will be logged. 
* The user will be able to fill out a form to update each purchase. This will include: the purchase item, the price of the item, and the category that the item was purchased (e.g., transportation, personal, rent, etc.).
* This information will be added to a list that tracks the purchases made. 
* The purchases made will pull a gif from the giphy api that is based on the item that was searched. 
* The application will automatically update the budget remaining after a purchase is inserted. 
* The budget can reset when the user presses "set new budget". If the user spends all their money in their budget, a note will appear telling them they went over budget (and by how much), and to reset the budget.
